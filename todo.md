[ ] Add a whitelist for extensions that can be ignored when disable all button clicked (Always On feature) using popups.

[x] remember the last state of app before it was turned off and start from there will set key to chrome store (appisEnabled) e.g doesnt remmeber that I had 7 apps on when i disabled and turned extension off. when turned back on it immediately starts at off instead of going straight on.

[x] invert the enabled icon to make it look like its a switch and not just a colour change
