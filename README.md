# Disable All Extensions 
This Chrome extension allows you to disable or enable all your extensions at once **with the click of a button** (because Chrome doesn't have this for some reason).


## How To Use

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ItzBlinkzy/disable-all-extensions.git
```

2.
Enter `chrome://extensions` into the address bar to view your extensions.

3. 
Load the unpacked extension.

_Made this in a day because I was bored and wanted to try and make an extension, however I do intend on updating it whenever I'm free._

_I may upload this to the Chrome Web Store depending on how much more work is done on the extension._
