# [Disable All Extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-all-extensions/ailfldpmpboolaihojfagmmfbhcgohne)

This Chrome extension allows you to disable or enable all your extensions at once **with the click of a button** (because Chrome doesn't have this for some reason).

# Install from Chrome Store (3K+ Users)

- Download [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-all-extensions/ailfldpmpboolaihojfagmmfbhcgohne)

## Download locally

- Clone the github repo.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ItzBlinkzy/disable-all-extensions.git
```

- Enter `chrome://extensions` into the address bar to view your extensions.

- Load the unpacked extension by selecting the folder of the cloned repo.

_Made this in a day because I was bored and wanted to try and make an extension, however I do intend on updating it whenever I'm free._

~~_I may upload this to the Chrome Web Store depending on how much more work is done on the extension._~~
_This has now been uploaded to the chrome store._
